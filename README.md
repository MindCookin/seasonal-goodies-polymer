# Seasonal Goodies (made with [polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/))

A list of available vegetables and fruits for the current season.

### Studies
This is one of a list of studies of using different Front End frameworks to run the app.
In this case is built with polymer and the [polymer-starter-kit](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit), with [firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) as the database.

### Dev
It uses the same processes as [polymer-starter-kit](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/start/psk/set-up.html#build-and-serve) so there are only two available commands:

###### Setup
`npm install -g gulp bower`
`npm i && bower i`

###### Build the application
`gulp`

###### Serve and watch
`gulp serve`

### Roadmap
* Add Unit Testing
* Search 
* Show vegetable descriptions and recipes
  * connect to external db services (Food API)
  * show vegetable as a single page
